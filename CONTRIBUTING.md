# Contributing Guide

Thank you so much for showing an interest in contributing to yedit! I am excited to see what you have to add :)

## 🦀 Rust Toolchain

yedit uses the nightly distribution of the rust toolchain. You can get on the nightly edition of rustfmt, the only toolchain component used by yedit, by running the following command:

```bash
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly
```

## 🏗️ Build System

yedit uses [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) for all build scripts. Please run the following command to install cargo-make:

```bash
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

Once you have cargo-make installed you can run `cargo make TASK_NAME` to run a certain task. All tasks are prefixed with `tasks.` and are stored in the [Makefile.toml](Makefile.toml) file. So if you wanted to build the development binary for example you would run the following command:

```bash
cargo make build-rust-dev
```

## 🧪 Linters

yedit only uses two linters: [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) and [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt). hadolint will lint the dockerfiles stored in [docker/](docker/) and rustfmt will lint the source code in [src/](src/). Please install hadolint using your system's package manager and rustfmt with the toolchain command provided in the [🦀 Rust Toolchain section](#-rust-toolchain).

That's all, good luck with your contribution, and please make an issue if anything doesn't make sense.
